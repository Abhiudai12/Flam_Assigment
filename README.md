üìù Description
This project is part of the FLAM (Fine-tuned Learning of Aesthetic Modelling) assignment, where the objective was to create a visually appealing and emotionally expressive image using various photo editing tools and techniques.

The final image reflects thoughtful editing decisions, focusing on enhancing lighting, composition, and visual depth while maintaining a natural look.

üîß Steps Followed
‚úÖ Image Preparation
Removed background from the subject image using Remove.bg.

Flipped the subject image horizontally using Photopea to match lighting direction of the background.

Enhanced contrast between left and right halves of the face for better lighting balance.

‚úÖ Background Integration
Sourced a suitable, aesthetic background from Google Images (visually calm and natural).

Rescaled and positioned the subject onto the background proportionally.

‚úÖ Finishing Touches
Added a drop shadow behind the subject to enhance depth.

Blurred the shadow slightly to make it more natural.

Adjusted brightness and contrast for better harmony between subject and background.

üñºÔ∏è Tools Used :

pixelcut.ai for background removal

Photopea (mostly used for all purposes)

Contrast/Brightness Adjustment

Drop Shadow and Gaussian Blur (Photopea)
